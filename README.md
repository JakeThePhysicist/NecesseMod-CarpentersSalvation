# Carpenter's Salvation
The early stages of a mod for the game Necesse that strives to add various building objects and cosmetic options to in game structures.

The creation and compiling of this mod was greatly aided by the helpful information and Example Mod Project from [Necesse's official modding documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTexy0ZwJmztm6KhvwUCpSbgdNFV5hxUOr_6rSiCyqvjlj80Sj28Alenodq6AbOfnKaWoj-zv0iziyL/pub).

Necesse modding and by extention **this mod** are in extremely early stages so there isn't really a proper ettiquite to mod uploading and descriptions.
So any of this mod's description is subject to change.
